Garbage.

Google Maps is fine. I have no idea what everyone in this thread is complaining about. I have had ZERO issue with it, and use it all the time.

Maybe my one complaint would be that when there are layered roads, or convoluted streets, it's not perfect at letting you know what you will need to do UNTIL YOU'RE RIGHT THERE and it's too late. That's it. It doesn't happen often, and it's a problem that is easily circumvented by looking at and knowing your route beforehand.",,e8l4h6f,-4,9rx6p2,claim-attack,attack,yes

"I have a lot of complaints with the way this article implies that the most recent 5 app additions are useless to most people... 

1) Sending you ETA is an incredibly useful feature, and something practically any navigation app should include.

2) Controlling music while navigating is an excellent function for Bluetooth users who want to be able to see what's playing and possibly change stations/artists without leaving the navigation app. My big complaint with this is that both Waze and gMaps limit this function to just one app (Spotify on Waze and Play Music on gMaps). I love it, since my previous MO was to use split screen between gMaps and gPlay Music.

3) Plan Group Dinners - I *could* see the use in this, but it's definitely not something that really needs to be built into a navigation app. It's moreso a situation where a dining app could integrate into a navigation app's API, instead of building the function directly into the nav app.

4) Matching you to a restaurant - This is just a new way of what they were already doing, and (in my opinion) doesn't deserve any criticism beyond being a bit too personal / assumptive about their users' preferences. This couldn't have required much more code than the previous functionality.

5) Sharing you battery level with friends - This is something I REALLY appreciate, as a motorcycle rider. I've had times where I'm planning on riding home and I'll share my location with my wife, since she tends to get nervous when I'm riding long distances. This allows her to know that if my battery is low I might not be able to respond until I get where I'm going.

The map doesn't need to be a multitool, but being able to easily and accurately mark parking lots, parking spaces tagged with hours/laws when applicable, building entrances and pickup/drop off zones would increase functionality for uber drivers and regular users. The directions are 93% great, but starting out and arriving for that last 5% is a pain. It's telling me ""you've arrived."" But im still a quarter mile away. They should fix these problems and streamline usability first, then worry about optional and-on functions.",Persea_americana,e8kprz1,1,e8kisbz,feature,,yes

"Google Plus is a great example of what's I'm saying here... It was relatively useless when a very small userbase. While it wasn't necessarily a bad app/site, it wasn't something that most people wanted or continued to use. As such, they've decided to close it down. Same goes for Inbox, Wave, Buzz, Talk, and I'm sure plenty of other apps, as well as functions within their apps that have been deprecated and removed. If a good enough amount of users didn't use their maps features,they'd be on the chopping block. Google is notorious for clipping apps early, sometimes before they've even had time to build a userbase.",phishfi,e8lr568,1,e8l8r1l,claim-attack,attack,yes

Then, they started applying pressure to get more users to come over from Facebook, including trying to make YouTube an additional to G+.

This happened until late summer 2015, when they finally listened to users' distaste for the mandatory G+ involvement, and they took away the account mandates and separated comments back into YouTube. This demonstrates my point that they cut app functions when they aren't as useful as they expected them to be.

"1. Showing ME the ETA is incredibly useful. The desktop version does this, and so does Google Maps (GM). Sending it to others is something I can accomplish with SMS or e-mail and doesn't need to be in the app. Location sharing has been around so my friends can see where I am.
2. I Bluetooth lock my phone to my car's stereo (bought a 3rd party head to do this) so I can control my music that way.
3. This is just stupid. For a NAVIGATION app. Add this to something else like Calendar or something.
4. Just hearing it described I want to turn it off. I'll eat almost any genre of food, depending upon my mood. If Google knows the kind of food I'm in the mood for, it's time to surrender.
5. It's called SMS. ""Oooh my phone just said I'm down to 5% battery. Don't freak if I drop out."" There ARE chargers that can link into a motorcycle as well. Again, this is putting too many functions in one app. I don't WANT my navigation turning into emacs or MS Word. That's the point of the article, and I agree with him.",PastaPappa,e8kou0c,8,e8kisbz,claim-attack,attack,yes
"I understand where you're coming from, but the truth is that most of those features are inherently useful additions to the Maps app. 

1) Sending an ETA to someone else (especially via the nav app) means that they can get more updated data than whatever you send them. Sure, you could see that Maps says you'll be at their place around 8:30, and text them as much, but with the ability to share your ETA, they may see changes that occur, saving you from having to text someone an update when they're waiting for you to get there so you can go someplace together, and it also helps provide a little more safety to you, by not requiring you to text or call them to give them an update when something like traffic or construction get in the way.

2) You do, but you're not the only driver in the world, and I think you'll have a hard time arguing that nav and music don't go hand-in-hand together. Most people listen to music while driving, and many more people are moving away from FM/Satellite radio and toward using their phones for music. 

>  so I can control my music that way.

When you say ""control"", I assume you mean ""skip, go back, pause, and play"", which is not the same as what's available through the music controls in Maps. It allows you to browse your most played stations and choose from among them, along with seeing what's playing, including album art, which only the most recent head units support...

3)  Again, this isn't the most useful thing for a navigation app, but it does help in that it could allow multiple users in different locations to find places that are about the same distance/time away from each other. For example, when three friends are all talking about where to go to dinner together, they can find the one place that would take them each 15 minutes to get to. This portion of the process is inherently navigation-based...

4) Sure, it's creepy, but they're putting together all of the places that you go/order from, and comparing it to where others have gone/regularly go to give you a good idea of what you would actually enjoy and be likely to go to again. This feature is super creepy, but I like that it gives me a great idea of whether it serves the type of food or has the sort of theme I'd regularly enjoy. All that aside, the fact that it creeps you out isn't a justification for why it shouldn't be a part of the app.

5) Again, this goes back to the fact that people have varying requirements. I'd love to see just how much it's actually used. I know I've used it quite a few times, but that's mostly because my gloves barely work with the touchscreen, so it's easier for me to just hit the share location/battery function to my wife before I get on the bike and leave it at that. It's still a function that's RELEVANT to a person while they're using a navigation app, so it's a far cry from the equivalent of MS Word. We aren't talking about a Maps Messenger here, we're talking about sharing things that are particularly relevant to a person at the time that they're using Maps. 

This is all similar to the features being talked about with Uber back in the day, where you could link your Spotify account to your Uber account and then your driver's Spotify mix could inject some of the music you prefer while you're riding in their vehicle. Sure, it's ""bloat"" if you don't use Spotify, but as a function of riding in a vehicle, which is so synonymous with listening to music, it's an additive feature that only really makes sense as an addition to Uber. Otherwise, Spotify would have to add some sort of playlist sharing function, which would probably require engagement on both parties' part to get it running. Of course, that doesn't make sense to do every time a user hops in a driver's car for 15 minutes, but with direct integration by Uber, it makes perfect sense.

"But they're not separate features at all. Plus, the ONLY time it's worth sharing your location to someone would be when your phone's GPS sensors are already active (like when navigating), otherwise, you're wasting battery without much reason. I could see branching the restaurant reviews into a separate app, but that doesn't make much sense when distance is a key factor for a lot of people when trying to decide where to eat, or when a food/stop decision is based on the route you're already on (like finding food ahead of you along the route you've already got Google maps showing you).
